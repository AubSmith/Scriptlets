Preparing the developer environment
To develop an Ansible module you first need a development environment that has all the required packages installed in it.

Clone the source of Ansible Repository from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git

Change directory to the locally cloned Ansible repo:

    cd ansible

Create python virtual environment:

    python3.9 -m venv ansible-venv

Activate the virtual environment and then install required packages that are listed in the requirements.txt file:

    . ./ansible-venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Ansible developers has created an environment script which is bash script that allows you to quickly checkout ansible source and switch to that environment.

Now, run the environment setup script:

    . ./hacking/env-setup

Note: Whenever youâ€™re ready to develop Ansible content you need to activate the virtual environment and then execute the environment setup script from the root of the Ansible repo. . ./ansible-venv/bin/activate && . ./hacking/env-setup

Run the ansible --version command to verify the developer environment is created successfully.

The output will look similar to the following:

ansible [core 2.12.0.dev0]  (devel 148d4f6248) last updated 2021/05/27 23:01:53 (GMT +550)
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/Users/ompragash/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /Users/ompragash/Git/ansible/lib/ansible
  ansible collection location = /Users/ompragash/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
  executable location = /Users/ompragash/Git/ansible/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.9.5 (v3.9.5:0a7dcbdb13, May  3 2021, 13:17:02) [Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)]
  jinja version = 3.0.1
  libyaml = True

From the first line, we can confirm that we are on the latest devel branch of the Ansible source.
