Using the new module in Ansible
As the my_test module is ready, it can be used with ansible and ansible-playbook executable binaries.

Include ~/ansible_collections to collections path.

    export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=~/ansible_collections

Refer to the Ansible documentation for details.

Activate the virtual environment and then execute the environment setup script from the root of the Ansible repo.

    . ~/ansible/ansible-venv/bin/activate && . ~/ansible/hacking/env-setup

Run Ansible Ad-hoc command and call the example_ns.example_collection.my_test module like below:

    ansible localhost -m example_ns.example_collection.my_test -a "name='hello' new=true"

localhost | CHANGED => {
    "changed": true,
    "message": "goodbye",
    "original_message": "hello"
}
The above output confirms that the command ran successfully.

To call a module from inside a collection in playbook, you can directly use the FQCN (Fully Qualified Collection Name) which is a recommended way or you can use collections playbook keyword and then call the modules with short names.

See Using collections in a Playbook for more details.

Congratulations!
You developed a basic Ansible module with understanding of the required Ansible format and documentation, a simple argument spec for declaring the module options.

See the programming tips and Python 3 compatibility pages for pointers on writing clean and concise module code.
