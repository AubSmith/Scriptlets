Module Standard Format
Let’s begin with developing the Ansible module.

If you want to contribute your module to most Ansible collections, you must write your module in Python and follow the standard format described in this link.

Start by adding #!/usr/bin/env python to the my_test.py module file. This “shebang” allows ansible_python_interpreter to work.

    cd ~/ansible_collections/example_ns/example_collection/plugins/modules
    vim my_test.py

Follow the shebang immediately with # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- to clarify that the file is UTF-8 encoded.

Now, add a copyright line with the original copyright holder and a license declaration.

Note: There are other types of license's available but for now we are using GNU GPL.

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    # Copyright: (c) 2018, Your Name <your.name@example.org>
    # GNU General Public License v3.0+ (see COPYING or https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)

Module file my_test.py should look like the above.
