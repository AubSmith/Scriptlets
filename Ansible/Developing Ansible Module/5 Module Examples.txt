Module Examples
After the DOCUMENTATION block comes the EXAMPLE block. This block contains examples of how the module works and how to use them inside the playbook. EXAMPLE block is written in multi-line plain-text YAML format.

Open my_test.py and copy the below code after DOCUMENTATION block:

    vim ~/ansible_collections/example_ns/example_collection/plugins/modules/my_test.py

Note: Turn on paste mode in vim by typing :set paste, press i and then paste the below text to avoid indendation errors.

EXAMPLES = r'''
# Pass in a message
- name: Test with a message
  my_namespace.my_collection.my_test:
    name: hello world

# pass in a message and have changed true
- name: Test with a message and changed output
  my_namespace.my_collection.my_test:
    name: hello world
    new: true

# fail the module
- name: Test failure of the module
  my_namespace.my_collection.my_test:
    name: fail me
'''
Save and exit Vim editor by typing :wq.

If your module supports check mode or diff mode then you can specify them in the example block.
