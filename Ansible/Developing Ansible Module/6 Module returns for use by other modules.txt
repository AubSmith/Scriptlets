Module returns for use by other modules
RETURN block comes after the DOCUMENTATION and EXAMPLE block. This block contains the information about the module returns for use by other modules.

Copy the below code into my_test.py file after the EXAMPLE block:

    vim ~/ansible_collections/example_ns/example_collection/plugins/modules/my_test.py

Note: Turn on paste mode in vim by typing :set paste, press i and then paste the below text to avoid indendation errors.

RETURN = r'''
# These are examples of possible return values, and in general should use other names for return values.
original_message:
    description: The original name param that was passed in.
    type: str
    returned: always
    sample: 'hello world'
message:
    description: The output message that the test module generates.
    type: str
    returned: always
    sample: 'goodbye'
'''
Save and exit Vim editor by typing :wq.

If your module doesnâ€™t return anything (apart from the standard returns), this section of your module should read: RETURN = r''' # ''' Otherwise, for each value returned, provide the fields that are mentioned in the doc here.
