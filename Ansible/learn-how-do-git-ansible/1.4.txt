Checking out the pull request on a branch
A user named test-ansible has created a pull request to fix the setfacl command issue in acl module.

Now, let's get the pull request that resolves the setfacl error submitted by test-ansible user and check it out on a branch:

    cd ~/ansible_collections/ansible/drill

Create and switch to a new branch named testing_PRXXXX, where the XXXX is the issue number associated with the pull request. For this course, we'll check this pull request and the issue number is 1 hence the branch name will be testing_PR1:

    git checkout -b testing_PR1
    git pull https://github.com/test-ansible/ansible.drill test_pr_example

The above command pulls the new code from the test-ansible user feature branch into the newly created branch.

The output confirms that the code is fetched from the userâ€™s feature branch successfully:

From https://github.com/test-ansible/ansible.drill
 * branch            test_pr_example -> FETCH_HEAD
