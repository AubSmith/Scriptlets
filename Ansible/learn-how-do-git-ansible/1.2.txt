Check out the source collection
To start with, create a directory with the below structure under user's home location to install the collection source.

    mkdir -p ~/ansible_collections/NAMESPACE/COLLECTION_NAME

For this course, we'll use a minimal collection ansible.drill where ansible is the namespace name and drill is the collection name and it will be created as follows:

    mkdir -p ~/ansible_collections/ansible/drill

Clone ansible.drill collection from Github to the above created path:

    git clone https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.drill.git ~/ansible_collections/ansible/drill

Checkout to pr_example branch:

    cd ~/ansible_collections/ansible/drill
    git checkout pr_example

Run git branch command to confirm that the current working branch is pr_example.

List the contents of the directory:

    ls
