## [1.11.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.11.1) - 2017-04-04
### Fixed
- CodeFormatting settings file (#727, #728).
- Whitelisted aliases comparison in AvoidUsingCmdletAliases rule (#739).

## [1.11.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.11.0) - 2017-03-01
### Added
- Built-in settings presets to specify settings from command line (#717). Currently, PSSA ships with `PSGallery`, `CodeFormatting`, `DSC`, and other settings presets. All of them can be found in the `Settings/` directory in the module. To use them just pass them as an argument to the `Settings` parameter. For example, if you want to run rules that *powershellgallery* runs, then use the following command.
```powershell
PS> Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path /path/to/your/module -Settings PSGallery
```
- Argument completion for built-in settings presets (#717).
- Argument completion for `IncludeRule` and `ExcludeRule` parameters (#717).
- Option to `PSCloseBrace` rule to add new line after the brace (#713).
- Option to `PSCloseBrace` rule to ignore expressions that have open and close braces on the same line (#706).

### Fixed
- Indentation when pipes precede new lines in a multi-line command expression in `PSUseConsistentIdentation` rule (#705).
- Handling of SubExpressionAsts (`$(...)`) in `PSUseConsistentIdentation` rule (#700).
- Performance issues caused by `get-command` cmdlet (#695).

### Changed

- Added -Severity to Get-ScriptAnalyzerRules. Get-ScriptAnalyzer -Severity will filter rules based on the severity given.
- Added Suppression functionality. Users are now able to specify suppression on certain parts of the scripts by specifying "SupressMessageAttribute" in the scripts. More details and documentations will be coming soon in blog posts. Also comes with this feature is the ability for users to display a list of suppressed messages.

### Rules:
- Added DSC Rules for resources including Parameter validation, Usage of standard DSC functions and return type validation. Rule checkings also support for DSC classes. Built-in DSC rules include:
    + UseStandardDSCFunctionsInResource
    + UseIdenticalParametersDSC
    + UseIdenticalMandatoryParametersDSC
    + ReturnCorrectTypesForDSCFunctions
- Added support in the engine to detect DSC configuration/resource files and disable default rule checkings on DSC configuration and resource files.

### Fixes:
- Improved heuristics to detect usage of Username and Password instead of PSCredential type.
- Improved accuracy in the detection of uninitialized variables.
- Improved error messages to include error line numbers and file names.
- Identified usage of PSBound parameters and PowerShell supplied variables such as $MyInvocation to avoid unnecessary noise in the results returned by some of the built-in rules.
