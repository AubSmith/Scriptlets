"The Dcpromo.exe remains in Windows Server 2012 for command-line unattended
installations only, and no longer runs the graphical installation wizard.
It is highly recommended that you discontinue use of Dcpromo.exe for
unattended installs and replace it with the ADDSDeployment module, as the
now-deprecated executable will not be included in the next version of Windows."
