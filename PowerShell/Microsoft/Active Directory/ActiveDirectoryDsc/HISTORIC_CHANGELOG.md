# Historic change log for xFailOverCluster

The release notes in the PowerShell Module manifest cannot exceed 10000
characters. Due to a bug in the CI deploy pipeline this is not handled.
This file is to temporary move the older change log history to keep the
change log short.

## 4.2.0.0

  - Correct value returned for RenameDefaultFirstSiteName
    ([issue #502](https://github.com/dsccommunity/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/502)).

## 4.1.0.0

- Changes to ActiveDirectoryDsc
  - New resource ADDomainControllerProperties ([issue #301](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/301)).
  - New resource ADForestFunctionalLevel ([issue #200](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/200)).
  - New resource ADDomainFunctionalLevel ([issue #200](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/200)).
  - Split the meta tests and the unit and integration tests in different
    AppVeyor jobs ([issue #437](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/437)).
  - Fixed all stub cmdlets and unit tests so the unit test can be run locally
    without having the ActiveDirectory module installed on the computer.
    This will also be reflected in the AppVeyor build worker where there
    will no longer be an ActiveDirectory module installed. This is
    to make sure that if the unit tests work locally they should also work
    in the CI pipeline.
  - Added new stubs for the cmdlets and classes to be used with unit tests.
    The new stubs are based on the modules ActiveDirectory and ADDSDeployment
    in Windows Server 2019. The stubs are generated using the PowerShell
    module *Indented.StubCommand*. Instructions how to generate stubs
    (for example for a new operating system) has been added to the README.md
    in the `Tests/Unit/Stubs` folder ([issue #245](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/245)).
  - Update all unit tests removing all local stub functions in favor of
    the new stub modules.
  - Enable PSScriptAnalyzer default rules ([issue #491](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/491)).
- Changes to ActiveDirectoryDsc.Common
  - Updated common helper function `Find-DomainController` with the
    optional parameter `WaitForValidCredentials` which will ignore
    authentication exceptions when the credentials cannot be authenticated.
  - Updated the function `Test-ADReplicationSite` to make the parameter
    `Credential` mandatory.
  - Update helper function `Add-ADCommonGroupMember` to reduce duplicated
    code, and add an evaluation if `Members` is empty.
  - Updated helper function `Restore-ADCommonObject` to write out a verbose
    message when no object was found in the recycle bin.
  - Updated helper function `Assert-MemberParameters` to not throw an error
    if the parameter `Members` is en empty array.
- Changes to WaitForADDomain
  - Correct grammar issues in example descriptions.
  - An optional parameter `WaitForValidCredentials` can be set to $true
    to tell the resource to ignore authentication errors ([issue #478](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/478)).
- Changes to ADDomain
  - The property `DomainName` will now always return the same value as
    was passed in as the parameter. For the fully qualified domain name
    (FQDN) of the domain see the new read-only property `DnsRoot`.
  - If the domain should exist, the resource correctly waits only 5 times
    when calling `Get-TargetResource` if the tracking file was previously
    created ([issue #181](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/181)).
  - The resource now throws if either one of the cmdlets `Install-ADDSForest`
    or `Install-ADDSDomain` fails, and will not create the tracking file
    ([issue #181](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/181)).
  - The resource now outputs the properties from `Get-TargetResource`
    when a domain cannot be found.
  - Minor casing corrections on the parameter and variable names.
  - Improved the parameter descriptions of the parameters `DomainName`
    and `Credential`.
  - If the tracking file is missing and the domain is found a warning
    message is now written asking the consumer to recreate the file.
  - Correctly outputs the time in seconds in the verbose message how long
    the resource waits between ech retry when looking for the domain
    (when a tracking file exist and the domain is not yet responding).
  - If the `Set-TargetResource` is called directly it will not try to
    create the domain if it already exist.
  - Added read-only property `DnsRoot` that will return the fully qualified
    domain name (FQDN) of the domain or child domain.
  - Added read-only property `Forest` that will return the fully qualified
    domain name (FQDN) of the forest that the domain belongs to.
  - Added read-only property `DomainExist` that will return `$true` if
    the domain was found, or `$false` if it was not.
- Changes to ADUser
  - Remove unused non-mandatory parameters from the Get-TargetResource ([issue #293](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/293)).
  - Added a note to the resource README.md that `RestoreFromRecycleBin`
    needs the feature Recycle Bin enabled.
- Changes to ADDomainController
  - Add InstallDns parameter to enable promotion without installing local
    DNS Server Service ([issue #87](https://github.com/PowerShell/xActiveDirectory/issues/87)).
- Changes to ADGroup
  - Now Get-TargetResource returns correct value when the group does not
    exist.
  - Added integration tests ([issue #350](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/350)).
  - Added a read-only property `DistinguishedName`.
  - Refactor the function `Set-TargetResource` to use the function
    `Get-TargetResource` so that `Set-TargetResource` can correctly throw
    an error when something goes wrong ([issue #151](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/151),
    [issue #166](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/166),
    [issue #493](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/493)).
  - It is now possible to enforce a group with no members by using
    `Members = @()` in a configuration ([issue #189](https://github.com/PowerShell/xActiveDirectory/issues/189)).
  - Added a note to the resource README.md that `RestoreFromRecycleBin`
    needs the feature Recycle Bin enabled ([issue #496](https://github.com/PowerShell/xActiveDirectory/issues/496)).
- Changes to ADOrganizationalUnit
  - Added a note to the resource README.md that `RestoreFromRecycleBin`
    needs the feature Recycle Bin enabled.
- Changes to ADComputer
  - Added a note to the resource README.md that `RestoreFromRecycleBin`
    needs the feature Recycle Bin enabled ([issue #498](https://github.com/PowerShell/xActiveDirectory/issues/498)).
  - Updated integration test to be able to catch when a computer account
    cannot be restored.

## 4.0.0.0

  - BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed the xActiveDirectory to ActiveDirectoryDsc
    and removed the 'x' from all resource names ([issue #312](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/312)).
  - The helper function `Find-DomainController` is exported in the module
    manifest. When running `Import-Module -Name ActiveDirectoryDsc` the
    module will also import the nested module ActiveDirectoryDsc.Common.
    It is exported so that the resource WaitForADDomain can reuse code
    when running a background job to search for a domain controller.
  - Module manifest has been updated to optimize module auto-discovery
    according to the article [*PowerShell module authoring considerations*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/performance-tuning/powershell/module-authoring-considerations)
    ([issue #463](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/463)).
  - Added a Requirements section to every DSC resource README with the
    bullet point stating "Target machine must be running Windows Server
    2008 R2 or later" ([issue #399](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/399)).
  - Added 'about_\<DSCResource\>.help.txt' file to all resources
    ([issue #404](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/404)).
  - Fixed an issue that the helper function `Add-ADCommonGroupMember` was
    not outputting the correct group name in a verbose message and in an
    error message.

    - Updated all types in the resources schema to use PascalCase.
  - Updated all resource read-only parameters to start the description
    with 'Returns...' so it is more clear that the property cannot be
    assigned a value.
  - The default value on resource parameters are now reflected in the parameter
    descriptions in the schema.mof (so that Wiki will be updated)
    ([issue #426](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/426)).

      [new helper functions for localization](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/StyleGuidelines.md#helper-functions-for-localization)
      ([issue #316](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/316),
      [issue #317](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/317)).

    - Refactor `Remove-DuplicateMembers` and added more unit tests
      ([issue #443](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/443)).
    - Minor cleanup in `Test-Members` because of the improved `Remove-DuplicateMembers`.
    - Minor cleanup in `Assert-MemberParameters` because of the improved `Remove-DuplicateMembers`.
  - Updated all the examples files to be prefixed with the resource

  - Fix examples that had duplicate guid that would have prevented them
    to be published.
  - Integration tests are now correctly evaluates the value from `Test-DscConfiguration`

- Changes to ADManagedServiceAccount
  - Added a requirement to README stating "Group Managed Service Accounts
    need at least one Windows Server 2012 Domain Controller"
    ([issue #399](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/399)).
  - Using `$PSBoundParameters.Remove()` returns a `[System.Boolean]` to
    indicate of the removal was done or not. That returned value has been
    suppressed ([issue #466](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/466)).
- Changes to ADComputer
  - BREAKING CHANGE: The previously made obsolete parameter `Enabled` has
    been removed and is now a read-only property. See resource documentation
    how to enforce the `Enabled` property.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed the parameter `DomainAdministratorCredential`

  - Now the resource can use built-in `PsDscRunAsCredential` instead of
    specifying the `Credential` parameter ([issue #367](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/367)).
  - New parameter `SiteName` can be used to wait for a domain controller
    in a specific site in the domain.

    For more information around these helper functions and localization
    in resources, see [Localization section in the Style Guideline](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/StyleGuidelines.md#localization).
  - Added common module *DscResource.Common* containing the helper function
    `Test-DscParameterState`. The goal is that all resource common functions
    are moved to this module (functions that are or can be used by more
    than one resource) ([issue #257](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/257)).

  - Updated unit tests to latest unit test template and refactored the
    tests for the function 'Set-TargetResource'.

    there is more than one object with the same name in the recycle bin.
    Now it uses the object that was changed last using the property
    `whenChanged` ([issue #271](https://github.com/PowerShell/ActiveDirectoryDsc/issues/271)).
- Changes to xADGroup
  - Restoring a group from the recycle bin no longer fails if there is
    more than one object with the same name in the recycle bin. Now it
