# Create a directory structure /tmp/files/pictures, /tmp/files/photos and /tmp/files/videos
# Copy all files that have a name starting with an a, b or c from /etc to /tmp/files
# From /tmp/files, move all files that have a name starting with an a or b to /tmp/files/photos,
# and all files with a name starting with a c to /tmp/files/videos
# Find all files on /etc that have a size small than 1000 bytes and copy those files to /tmp/files/pictures
# In /tmp/files, create a symbolic link to /var
# Create a compressed archive file of the /home directory
# Extract this compressed archive file with relative file names to /tmp/archive
