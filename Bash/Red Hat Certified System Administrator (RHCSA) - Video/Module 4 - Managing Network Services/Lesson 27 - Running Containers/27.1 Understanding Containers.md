Container is a complete package to run an application, which contains all application dependencies
Allow different versions of app dependencies side-by-side
Run on top of container engine
RHEL 8 - Container engine = CRI-O. Comprises Buildah, Podman, Skopeo. OS kernel not in container and offered by host OS
Kernel must be Linux Kernel
Containers run as process

2 Types of container images
App containers used to run common apps
System containers used as foundation to build custom images

Container requirements:
Rely on features provided by OS:
     - Namespaces for isolation between processes
     - Control Group (cgroup) for resource management
     - SELinux to ensure security

One container runs one application
Multiple applications can be cconected in Microsoervices
At enterprise level orchestration is needed like Kubernetes or OpenShift

RHEL 8 no Docker support instead use
     - podman - manage containers and images
     - buildah - create new images
     - skopeo - inspect/delete/copy/sign images

Containers needing to run on priviledged port need to run with root privileges
Podman supports rootless containers
Rootless containers will run as non-root user

Kubernetes used to scale containers and for orchestration
Red Hat OpenShift is the Red Hat Kubernetes distribution. Offers additional features to Kubernetes
