# The simplest method to get user input at a shell prompt is the read command. A simple demonstration:

while true; do
    read -p "Do you wish to install this program?" yn
    case $yn in
        [Yy]* ) make install; break;;
        [Nn]* ) exit;;
        * ) echo "Please answer yes or no.";;
    esac
done

# Another method is Bash's select command. Here is the same example using select:

echo "Do you wish to install this program?"
select yn in "Yes" "No"; do
    case $yn in
        Yes ) make install; break;;
        No ) exit;;
    esac
done

# With select you don't need to sanitize the input â€“ it displays the available choices, and you type a number corresponding to your choice.
# It also loops automatically, so there's no need for a while true loop to retry if they give invalid input.

# List all png files
ls *.png

# List all files named file1
ls file1*

# List all files ending png
ls | grep png$
