Comparison operators
The equality operator == is one of a family of operators that you can use to compare two values. The following table doesn't show all possible operators. These are the comparison operators you're likely to use most often.

Operator	Description
==	        Equality operator
!=	        Inequality operator
>	        Greater than operator
<	        Less than operator
>=	        Greater than or equal to operator
<=	        Less than or equal to operator
The inequality operator != evaluates to True when the operands on either side aren't the same. This concept can be a bit confusing, but sometimes you want to ensure that two values aren't equal.
