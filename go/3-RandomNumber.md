1) Encryption without randomness is not secure!
2) Real random numbers cannot be gnerated by software, and rely on phsical source.
3) Software is pseudo random.
4) Symmetric Key - not algebra based
5) Asymmetric key - algebra based
6) One-time pad - single weakness = key is too long and too hard to share between sender and receiver
7) KDY cannot add extra info to key material. Can only change format
